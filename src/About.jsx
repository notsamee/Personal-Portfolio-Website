            <p className="about-text">My name is Samee Hanif, and I am a Computer Science major at Toronto Metropolitan University, formerly known as Ryerson University. My journey in computer science began in 2016 during my grade 6 year of elementary school, sparking a passion that has only grown stronger with time. Starting early allowed me to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, enabling me to tackle various projects and challenges with a creative, out-of-the-box approach.</p>
            <p className="about-text">I was first introduced to computer science through the simple drag-and-drop program Scratch when I was 11. This initial exposure quickly led me to discover Python, where I spent countless hours exploring and experimenting with different projects and problems. As I progressed through high school, I broadened my knowledge by learning various programming languages, concepts, and software engineering strategies. This foundational experience has been instrumental in my participation in hackathons and the completion of personal projects, such as this website.</p>
            <p className="about-text">I'm driven by a profound passion for using computer science to address real-world challenges and create positive impacts. My primary ambition is to focus this passion to drive innovation within the realms of computer science and engineering. Whether it's through developing new technologies or optimizing existing systems, I am dedicated to contributing to advancements that improve people's lives and solve pressing issues.</p>
            <p className="about-text">Outside of my academic pursuits, I maintain an active lifestyle. I frequently participate in sports and physical activities, enjoy exploring my city, and indulge my curiosity by reading articles and watching documentaries on diverse subjects. These hobbies help me stay balanced and enhance my creativity and problem-solving skills.</p>
            <p className="about-text">I am committed to making a difference in the world by applying my expertise where it's needed most. I am eager to connect with like-minded individuals, industry professionals, and potential collaborators. Whether it's working on innovative projects, participating in community initiatives, or exploring new opportunities, I am always open to conversations and collaborations that can lead to impactful outcomes.</p>
